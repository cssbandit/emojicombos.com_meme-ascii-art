# ASCII Meme Gallery

A collection of ASCII art memes and text-based humor, ready for deployment on Netlify.

## Features

- Static HTML site with ASCII art memes
- Responsive design
- Fast loading with optimized caching
- No server-side dependencies

## Deployment

### Netlify (Recommended)

1. **Drag & Drop Method:**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Sign up/login to your account
   - Drag the entire project folder (excluding cache directories) to the deploy area
   - Your site will be live in seconds!

2. **GitHub Integration:**
   - Push your code to GitHub (excluding cache files via .gitignore)
   - Connect your GitHub repo to Netlify
   - Netlify will automatically deploy on every push

### File Size Optimization

The project is optimized for deployment:
- Cache directories are excluded via `.gitignore`
- Large backup files are filtered out
- Total deployment size: ~25MB (vs 220MB with cache)

## Local Development

```bash
# Using Python
